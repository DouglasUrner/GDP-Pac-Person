# Unity-New-Project

A set of files to create an empty Unity project.

Using:

1. Create an empty repository on GitHub (do not initialize).
1. Clone this package.
1. Rename the resulting folder to your project name.
1. Reset the origin to point to the empty repository that you
created.

upstream repository.
