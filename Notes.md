# Maze Generation

Potentially interesting posts and articles:

* [2D Pac-Man style Maze Generation](https://www.contralogic.com/2d-pac-man-style-maze-generation) -
Algorithm to generate a random maze with no code examples.
Seems relatively easy to implement. This one defines "Pac-Man"
style to mean "no dead ends" and "no rooms."
Does not seem to include provision for a "ghost house."

* [Pac-Man Maze Generation](https://shaunlebron.github.io/pacman-mazegen/) -
Another random generator, this one is more "true" to the mazes
in Pac-Man. Code, in Python, is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/shaunlebron/pacman-mazegen).

Implementations:

* [Pac-Man](https://github.com/masonicGIT/pacman) - A historical tribute and accurate remake of the
original Pac-Man arcade game in Javascript.

* [Pac-Man for iOS](https://github.com/kean/Pacman) - Written in Objective C.
